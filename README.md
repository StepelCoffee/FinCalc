# FinCalc
Package that gathers typical financial calculations.

I have just begun contributing to it. Let's see where it goes. I just want to have fun and maybe use them here and there in other projects, 
so I'm pretty sure you can find those somewhere else and better implemented.

Until now it has some basic functions on Cash Flow Series, Interest Rate Calculations and Portfolio Theory.
